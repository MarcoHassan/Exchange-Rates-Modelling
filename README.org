#+AUTHOR: Marco Hassan

This repository contains my R and LATEX code for my master thesis in
line with the idea of /Reproducible Research/.

The idea was to analyze the foreign exchange disconnect puzzle
claiming a weak relation among macroeconomic fundamentals and
FX-rates. Given the small sample used by the reference papers [[https://scholar.google.it/scholar?hl=it&as_sdt=0%252C5&q=meese+rogoff+1983&btnG=&oq=meese][Meese
and Rogoff (1983a & 1983b)]] that
documented the phenomena I decided to further investigate the puzzle
collecting data for a 20 years period and to contribute to the
literature by testing the performance of univariate and multivariate
models. Moreover, on the top of it I assessed the performance of the
generalized tree structured model of [[https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/32631/][Audrino and Bühlmann (2001)]]
similar to the CART models.

** Abstract

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  This study reports an estimation of the out-of-sample performance of
  univariate, multivariate, and non-linear parametric monetary models
  contributing to the analysis of the Meese Rogoff paradox for the
  empirical CHF/USD, GBP/USD and JPY/USD series. 20 years of monthly
  observations and five models are analysed.  In line with the
  academic literature I find a random walk model to be the best
  univariate model to capture the unit root behaviour of FX-rates and
  to forecast the latter out-of-sample.  Nonetheless, in contrast with
  the general academic literature I do not find multivariate models
  to underperform a random walk model when forecasting FX-rates out of
  sample. Rather, I find that a vector error correction model
  representing the cointegration evidence among macroeconomics
  fundamentals and FX-rates to marginally outperform a random walk model
  for all the country series and at all estimation lags. Finally, the
  considereable out of sample performance of the generalized
  structured model points to non linear macroeconomic effects in line with
  the stable relation properties of the co-integration analysis suggesting
  a sluggish adjustment process to the stable lung run equilibria rather than
  a gradual adjustment as implied in the error correction model.

** Code

The code is divided in chapters. 

For each step of the thesis a R markdown was written.

 - *0 - functions:* contains globally specified functions that are going
   to be leveraged throughout the various scripts.

 - *1 - Data Import:* leverages quantmod =API= to connect to the
   St. Louis FRED databases and download the macroeconomic series of
   interest.

 - *2 - Data Cleaning:* here the series are treated and checked for
   structural breaks, mean stationarity and variance
   stationarity. Moreover the series are de-seasonalized according to
   spectral peaks and a parametric Fourier estimation leveraging the
   classical trigonometric functions.

 - *2.1  Cointegration Test:* given the evidence for integrated series
   of order 1, resulting from script 2, co-integration is tested in
   the series according to the Johansen Eigenvalue test statistic.

 - *3 - Stationary Linear Modeling:* fit two univariate models
   (structural OLS & Transfer Function Models) to the treated
   stationary series.

 - *3.1 Levels Linear Modeling:* fit a vector error correction model
   and a VAR in difference.

 - *4. Linear Fit Comparison:* plot the out-of-sample performance of
   the univariate. Moreover, it computes the
   bootstrapped p-values for the underlying superior predictability
   test among the models necessary to derive a model confidence set as
   in Hansen (2011).

 - *4.1 Common Trend Plot and Linear Fit:* repeats *4*, for the
   multivariate models also decomposing the co-integration relation
   extracting the common trends as in Gonzalo and Grange(1995).

 -  *5 - Generalized Tree Structured Model:* Fit the generalized tree
   structured threshold model of Audrino and Bühlmann to the
   analysis with local structural OLS fit without inclusion of lagged terms.

 -  *5.1  GTS VAR:* Analogous to *5* for a multivariate local
   parametric fit.

 - *6 - GTS Comparison:* Analogous to *4* for the generalized tree
   structured model.


*  Notes

Coding the generalized tree structure model was a valuable exercise
given the complexity of the underlying algorithm and the need to
partition at each step the data set at each terminal node, combining
the local parametric residuals of the partition with the residuals of
each other terminal node and to compare the result with all of the
other possible partitions in the partition space.

After heaving debugging and testing the code is functioning although
surely not efficient. Functions 9-15 fully implement the algorithm
outlined by Audrino & Bühlmann. 

At the moment the code is functional
just for the data set created in this repository. It can be though
easily generalized to ask for a parametric model as argument together
with the exogenous and endogenous variables. 

Moreover, if you will ever have time and interest it will be a good
exercise to start to profile and optimize the code. You can compare
the results of your model to the one of [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/party/party.pdf][party]] that should achieve a
similar task to the one developed here. Due to the vague explanation
of the package workings when fitting the model via likelihood, I
preferred to implement the code by myself as a valuable learning experience.
