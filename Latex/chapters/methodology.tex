\subsection{Modeling Approach}
\label{sub:models}

\subsubsection{Structural Model}

The basic structural model encompassing all of the different monetary models
discussed in the introductory session is of the following form:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:structural}
  s = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}(m - m^{*}) + \beta_{2}(y-y^{*}) + \beta_{3}(r-r^{*})
  + \beta_{4}(\pi - \pi^{*}) + \beta_{5}(TB - TB^{*}) + \varepsilon
\end{equation}

where $s$ represents the logarithm of the indirect quote of FX-rates, i.e. the
foreign exchange value of a dollar unit, $m-m^{*}$ represents the logarithm of
the U.S. and foreign country money mass supply differential, $y-y^{*}$ the logarithm
of the U.S. and foreign GDP level, $r-r^{*}$ the short term U.S. forign country
interest rate differential, $\pi - \pi^{*}$ the U.S. and foreign country inflation
rate differential, $TB - TB^{*}$ the U.S. foreign country current account differential
normalized to be one at the beginning of the sample period and finally where
$\varepsilon$ represents the error term of the regression capturing all of the
other factors not expressed in the model.\\
The model above encompasses all of the monetary models discussed. In the specific
the most basics monetary model, the Frenkel-Bilson model logically inferred from
the PPP proposition assumes $\beta_{4} = \beta_{5} = 0$. The Dornbusch model allowing
a sluggish price adjustment behaviour and predicting FX-overshooting
assumes $\beta_{5} = 0$ and finally the Hooper-Morton model poses no restriction on
the coeffcients of equation \ref{eq:structural}. Such a structural model will consequently
be estimated allowing for four different parametric models of interest, which will be discussed next.

\subsubsection{Univariate Models}
\label{sub:univariate}

The most basic model that will be tested is an OLS model as in the benchmark papers of Meese
and Rogoff (1983a, 1983b, \cite{MeeseRogoffa, MeeseRogoffb}). In this basic first model the
coefficients of equation \ref{eq:structural} will be computed without looking at any lagged effect.
In contrast to it a second more flexible model will be applied to capture possible lagged effects
of the macroeconomics fundamentals. In comparison to the Meese and Rogoff papers where the authors decided
to capture the possibility of lagged terms by incorporating autoregressive models giving a higher
importance on more recent observations we decided to apply the transfer function models widely spread in
the fields of engineering such as control systems and electronic circuits. These models have been poorly
discussed in the field of economics with the exception of Tustin (1957, \cite{Tustin}) that tried to
make the point for applying the models into the economics modeling field.\\
Transfer function models relates a given set of inputs to an output variable through the following general formula

\begin{equation} \label{eq:transfer}
  Y_{t} = \mu + \frac{(\omega_{0}+\omega_{1}B^{1}+\dots+\omega_{s}B^{s})}{1-\delta_{1}B^{1}-\dots-\delta_{r}B^{r}}X_{t-b} + \varepsilon_{t}
\end{equation}

where $X$ represent a matrix of exogenous terms, $\mu$ the optional term modeling the mean of the series and
$\varepsilon$ the non-captured variation in the series. Moreover the above ratio represents the transform
function of the regressors matrix and is especially caracterized by the order of the denominator and
nominator terms. $r$, the order of the denominator term, expresses the rate of the decay pattern, where
a higher term indicates a slower decay.  $s$, the order of the denominator term, expresses the persistence of
so called unpatterned spikes, that is the persistence of effects that are not captured in the decay pattern.
Finally, the $b$ teerm in the matrix of input represent the dead time, that is the time it takes for the dependent
variable to react to some changes in the input matrix. This is of primary importance as it might very well be
that some shift in macroeconomics fundamentals just start to display effects after a certain amount of time when
the economics actors start to perceive the change.\\
Due to the flexible nature of the latter model, we believe that it is better suited and preferrable to
capture the true distributed lags present in the structural model of equation \ref{eq:structural} compare with
the smoothed autoregressive model applied by Meese and Rogoff with the arbitrarly chosen smoothing
term of 0.95 (See Meese and Rogoff (1983a pp. 7, \cite{MeeseRogoffa})).


\subsubsection{Multivariate Models}
The above discussed models rely on the exogeneity of the independent variables. If the assumption
fails the model will be biased and would lead to misleading conclusion as the independence of the
sample distribution would not be guaranteed. In practice this poses an issue for the estimation
of the structural model of equation \ref{eq:structural}. While some variables as the monetary
mass and the output gap are commonly treated as exogenous variables in the underlying monetary models
the practice suggest that such macroeconomic variables might very well be influenced by the
movements of FX-rates. On the top of it other variables such as short term interest rates differentials
are treated as endogenous even in the underlying monetary models and therefore require a different estimation
compared to the one outlined in the models of the previous section.\\
To obviate the above issues Meese and Rogoff (1983a and 1983b, \cite{MeeseRogoffa, MeeseRogoffb}) analyzed the structural model
of interest through a vector autoregressive model firstly introduced by Sims (1980, \cite{Sims1980}).
In the general case the model consists of a system of equations of the form

\begin{equation} \label{eq:VAR}
y_{t} =  \Phi_{0}+ \Phi_{1}y_{t-1} + \Phi_{2}y_{t-2} + \dots + \Phi_{n}y_{t-n} + \varepsilon_{t}
\end{equation}

where $y$ is a vector containing the endogenous variables of interest, $\Phi_0$ is a vector of constant,
$\Phi_1,  \dots  , \Phi_n$ are matrices describing the effect of lagged endogenous variables on the levels of
the current variables and $\varepsilon$ captures the equations specific error term.
The resulting model will model the endogeneity present in the monetary structural model allowing a consistent
OLS estimation as far as the error terms of the equations will be uncorrelated.
\\
Despite the described vector autoregressive model well manages to model the endogeneity of macroeconomic
variables we question whether a restricted form of it could yield more efficient and reliable estimates capturing
the FX-rates and the monetary models relation. This is especially motivated by the cointegration theory developed
by Engle and Granger (1987, \cite{EngleGranger}) and the well known evidence of non stationary macroeconomics
times series \footnote{See for instance Gil-Alana and Robinson (1997, \cite{GilAlanaRobinson})}. This is especially
important given the demonstrated evidence of Phillips (1986, \cite{Phillips}) that set down the theoretical fundamentals
showing that parameter estimates of cointegrated series will not converge in probability and will not converge to any
non-degenerate distribution in the asymptotic case if the case of a misspecified OLS estimate as potentially equation \ref{eq:VAR}.
\\
We propose therefore a test for cointegration among the macroeconomics series based on Johansen (1991, \cite{Johansen})
and we consequently propose a vector error correction model of the form

\begin{align}
  \Delta y_t =& \ \Pi y_{t-1} + \sum^{p-1}_{i=1} \Phi^{*} \Delta y_{t-i} + \varepsilon_t \nonumber\\
  \Phi^{*} =& \ - \sum^{p}_{i=j+1} \Phi_i, \ \  j = 1, \dots, p-1 \label{eq:VECM}\\
  \Pi =& \ -(I - \Phi_1 - \dots - \Phi_p) \nonumber\
\end{align}

where $\Pi y_{t-1}$ of equation \ref{eq:VECM} represent the error correction term and $y_i$ and $\Phi$
refer to the variables described in the unrestricted vector autoregressive model of \ref{eq:VAR}.

\subsection{Forecasting Approach}

The four described models described above will be validated by looking at their ability to
forecast FX-rates out of sample. In this sense the 245 observations sample is splitted in
a training and validation sample. Three fourth of the total observations will be used for
training the four models outlined above at first. In comparison to Meese and Rogoff
(1983b, \cite{MeeseRogoffb}) we will not try any restricted estimation based on the theoretical
monetary models literature but will rather estimate unrestricted versions for all of the models
outlined with the exception of the vector error correction model described in \ref{eq:VECM}, given
the by product VAR model restriction imposed by the latter.\\
All of the four different models will be estimated according to the most general structural model
described in \ref{eq:structural} without restrictions. Based on the estimation results augmented
Mincer-Zarnowitz tests first presented in Mince and Zarnowitz (1969, \cite{MincerZarnowitz})
will be estimated in order to check whether there is evidence in the sample to consider
restricted monetary models. 

Based on the first estimation we proceeded by calculating the out of sample performance of the
different models applying a rolling forecast in analogy to the benchmark papers. This will consist
of a reestimation of the four outlined models for each new forecasting point. Given the decision
to estimate the out of sample model performance at one, three, six and twelve months lags the above
corresponds of a model reestimation at such frequencies. Important is nonetheless to underline how
the results of the Mincer-Zarnowitz tests will be extended for each of the subsequent models applied
in the rolling forecast. This means that given statistical significant evidence for the Null of a
restricted hypothesis in the first three fourth of the sample the same restricted model will be used for
subsequent model estimations. \\
Finally, as in the benchmark papers, we will allow the univariate models
described in \ref{sub:univariate} a richer set of information compared to the random walk.
In the specific while the random walk and the multivariate model will use the $\mathscr{F}_{t-1} = {F_0, \ \dots, \ F_{t-1}}$
information set, where $F_i$ represent a set containing all of the available information at timepoint $i$.
By contrast the univariate models will dispose of $\mathscr{F}_t \setminus s_t$, where $s_t$ represents
the FX-rate at time point t.
In simple terms this means that we are going to give the univariate models the vantage of using the actual realizations of
macroeconomics variables at timepoint $t$ for estimating the FX-rates at the corresponding time period without the need
of estimating them.

\section{Note}
While the forecasts generated in this study are based on models with
freely-estimated coefficients, elsewhere [Meese and Rogoff (1983)] we try
forecasting with the structural models using a grid of coefficient constraints
drawn from the theoretical and empirical literature on money demand and
purchasing power parity.

\section{Why MAE?}
A possible problem with all the techniques listed thus far is that they
minimize criteria based on squared deviations. These type of criteria are
inappropriate if, for example, exchange rates follow non-normal stable-
Paretian distributions with infinite variance, as suggested by Westerfield
(1977).

\section{times series without adjustments}
While the relative performance of the six univariate forecasting techniques
is of interest in itself, we shall only report detailed results for the long AR
model without trend, seasonal adjustment, or differencing. This model's
performance characterizes those of the best univariate models; we will discuss
the results of the other univariate models only to a lesser degree.
