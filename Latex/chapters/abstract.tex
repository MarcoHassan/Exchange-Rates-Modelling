  This study reports an estimation of the out-of-sample performance of
  univariate, multivariate, and non-linear parametric monetary models
  contributing to the analysis of the Meese Rogoff paradox for the
  empirical CHF/USD, GBP/USD and JPY/USD series. 20 years of monthly
  observations and five models are analysed.  In line with the
  academic literature I find a random walk model to be the best
  univariate model to capture the unit root behaviour of FX-rates and
  to forecast the latter out-of-sample.  Nonetheless, in contrast with
  the general academic literature I do not find multivariate models
  to underperform a random walk model when forecasting FX-rates out of
  sample. Rather, I find that a vector error correction model
  representing the cointegration evidence among macroeconomics
  fundamentals and FX-rates to marginally outperform a random walk model
  for all the country series and at all estimation lags. Finally, the
  considereable out of sample performance of the generalized
  structured model points to non linear macroeconomic effects in line with
  the stable relation properties of the co-integration analysis suggesting
  a sluggish adjustment process to the stable lung run equilibria rather than
  a gradual adjustment as implied in the error correction model.
